Cosmetx 🧢
This allows you to gain access to all cosmetics, including the unobtainable ones!
Client-side only!

Requires 📦
Utilla 1.6.13

How it works! ⚙️
In DnSpy you can find out where the cosmetics are handled.
So in GorillaNetworking.CosmeticsController.GetUserCosmeticsAllowed() you can apply a patch that gives you all cosmetics.
